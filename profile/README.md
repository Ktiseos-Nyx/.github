## Ktiseos Nyx

<hr>

Ktiseos Nyx is a space cultivated by Earth & Dusk Media, a name whispered from the echoes of Ktisis Hyperboreia, the level 87 dungeon introduced in Final Fantasy XIV's Endwalker expansion. 
Like the Ktiseos gear found within that ancient place, we see power and potential in what's often overlooked, a place where we are allowed to grow and expand. We are a collective of coders, gamers, and artists whose experiences and perspectives shape the world around us. 
We believe that the most transformative ideas are born when we dare to stray from the well-worn paths. 
Ktiseos Nyx is a refuge for those who see the value of community, where the foundations we build are as important as the tools themselves. We don't aim to simply conform to the function of society, but to create connections, push limits, and create a sanctuary for the bold and brilliant. In the darkness we find our strength, together, crafting a new dawn.
