# Ktiseos Nyx

Ktiseos Nyx is a space cultivated by Earth & Dusk Media, a name whispered from the echoes of Ktisis Hyperboreia, the level 87 dungeon in *Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker*. Like the Ktiseos gear found within that ancient place, we see power and potential in what's often overlooked â€“ a place where we are allowed to grow, experiment, and expand. We are a collective of coders, gamers, artists, and thinkers whose diverse experiences and perspectives shape the world around us. We believe that the most transformative ideas are born when we dare to stray from the well-worn paths.

Ktiseos Nyx is a refuge for those who value community, where the foundations we build are as important as the tools themselves. We don't aim to simply conform; we strive to create connections, push limits, and foster a sanctuary for the bold and brilliant. In the darkness, we find our strength; together, we craft a new dawn.

Our commitment to this vision extends to the very core of our process:

*   **Open and Collaborative:** Code within Ktiseos Nyx is a shared resource, a living testament to collaboration. We embrace diverse approaches to development, including the responsible use of advanced tools like Large Language Models. Our projects are generally licensed under the [MIT License], chosen for its permissive nature and to encourage broad collaboration and reuse.
*   **Security Conscious:** We rigorously vet the packages and dependencies we use, prioritizing security and stability. While striving for user-friendliness in all our tools, we also challenge ourselves to anticipate future needs, both niche and widespread. We are committed to addressing security vulnerabilities promptly and transparently.
*   **Community Driven:** We operate transparently, with key decisions made collaboratively. We welcome contributions from everyone, regardless of skill level. If you're interested in contributing, please get ahold of us!.
*   **Respectful and Inclusive:** We are committed to maintaining a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors. 
*   **Experimentation Embraced:** We recognize that true exploration involves venturing into uncharted territory, sometimes even challenging our own established guidelines. We embrace mistakes as learning opportunities, essential steps on the path to discovery. We're not afraid to break things to find better solutions, because the value of shared progress outweighs the fear of imperfection.

We believe that code, like any art form, is a collaborative endeavor. Former collaborators retain the full rights granted by the applicable licenses, including the freedom to refactor, enhance, and reimagine their work. This is not about ownership, but about fostering a continuous cycle of growth and innovation.

Join us in building a future where technology empowers, connects, and inspires.
